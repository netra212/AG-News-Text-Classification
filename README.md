# Description:
This repository is focused on classifying news articles from the AG News dataset into various categories. The AG News dataset consists of 120,000 training articles and 7,600 test articles, organized into 4 primary classes: World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech. The repository uses a combination of traditional machine learning and deep learning models, including algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and advanced models such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Transformers (e.g., BERT).

The project also focuses on the integration of advanced text preprocessing techniques for better feature extraction, like tokenization, lemmatization, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec embeddings.

## Features:

* **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Scripts for downloading, cleaning, and transforming the AG News dataset.

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and basic statistical analysis of the dataset to better understand its structure.

* **Text Preprocessing:** Functions for cleaning, tokenizing, and transforming raw text into meaningful features for model training.

* **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of several machine learning models like SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest for classification.

* **Deep Learning Models:** Advanced models using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), LSTM, CNN, and Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT).

* **Evaluation Metrics:** Code for evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, with the ability to visualize confusion matrices and ROC curves.

* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Scripts to optimize models through grid search and random search techniques for finding the best hyperparameters.

## Goal:
The goal of this repository is to explore the use of multiple machine learning algorithms for text classification on the AG News dataset. The project will also demonstrate how to handle text data efficiently and test both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning models for multi-class classification tasks.

## Usage:

 * Train machine learning models on the AG News dataset.
 * Experiment with preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
 * Compare different machine learning algorithms and deep learning models to assess performance on multi-class classification tasks.
